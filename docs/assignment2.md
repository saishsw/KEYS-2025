## Assignment 2: Introduction to your Research

### Purpose: 

My research consists of writing programs that organize and visualize large sets of data into reproducible dashboards which are integrated with AI. This aligns with two main goals of my lab: first, AI integration - supercharging existing programs with AI to make them more interactive and powerful, and secondly, reproducibility - ensuring that the code can be utilized by people around the globe with minimal obstacles. 

### Prior Research

Previous software on this idea like QueryChat(posit-dev, 2025) a package that allows you to interact with your data using AI and Large Language Models. Our goal is to make this more powerful, organized, and reproducible. Another example of previous work on this topic is the Arizona Voter Project - which visualizes voter data in an accessible, easy to read manner (Home | the Arizona Voter Project, 2024).

### Need For Study 

Currently, researchers donâ€™t have access to the latest, powered by the strongest AI, data organization platform, so the goal of my project will be to be able to create one that is very accessible.

#### Problem Statement: 

Research Question: How can one streamline LLM-integrated personal workflows to improve the efficency of data analysis and open-science.

Hypothesis 0: Creating reproducible LLM-integrated dashboards will increase the efficiency of data analysis and open-science.
