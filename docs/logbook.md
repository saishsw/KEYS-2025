## KEYS Internship

### 6/9/2025
Today, I started with learning how to use the Discovery Environment on CyVerse - which allows me to run applications such as Visual Studio Code(VS Code), RStudio, and Jupyter Notebook. Next, I started building my Vibecoding setup by downloading Cline - an AI Autonomous Coding Agent for VS Code, and I encountered a roadblock when trying to generate a Google Gemini API to use in Cline - I didn't have permission to generate a Gemini API Key. Then set up Github Copilot on VS Code as well as turning on MCP(Model Context Protocol) integration into VS Code. I followed this with completing [KEYS Assignment 1: Internship Description](assignment1.md). Next, I started learning about the current AI Landscape, the Ethics of AI, and Prompt Engineering using Dr. Tyson Swetnam's [Generative AI and Prompt Engineering Workshop](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/). I practiced these prompt engineering skills using by writing these [Prompt Engineering Examples](promptengineeringexamples.md). 
### 6/10/2025
Today, I revisted the Gemini API generation issue, and I learned that Dr. Swetnam needs to go into the system and give me permission to generate an API Key from UofA's Gemini. As Dr. Swetnam was working on that, I used [CyVerse's Verde AI](https://chat.cyverse.ai/) to generate an API Key to use in Cline. I originally  used the Deepseek-R1 model, but it was too verbose and glitchy, so I switched to the llama-4-scout model, which worked very well with Cline.
