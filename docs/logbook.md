## KEYS Internship

### 6/9/2025
Today, I downloaded Cline - an AI Autonomous Coding Agent for Visual Studio Code, and encountered a roadblock when trying to generate a Google Gemini API to use in Cline. It was fixed by [x]. Then set up Github Copilot on VS Code as well as turning on MCP(Model Context Protocol) integration into VS Code. I followed this with completing [KEYS Assignment 1: Internship Description](assignment1.md).
