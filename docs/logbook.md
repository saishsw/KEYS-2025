## KEYS Internship

### 6/9/2025
Today, I started with learning how to use the Discovery Environment on CyVerse - which allows me to run applications such as Visual Studio Code(VS Code), RStudio, and Jupyter Notebook. Next, I started building my Vibe coding setup by downloading Cline - an AI Autonomous Coding Agent for VS Code, and I encountered a roadblock when trying to generate a Google Gemini API to use in Cline - I didn't have permission to generate a Gemini API Key. Then set up Github Copilot on VS Code as well as turning on MCP(Model Context Protocol) integration into VS Code. I followed this with completing [KEYS Assignment 1: Internship Description](assignment1.md). Next, I started learning about the current AI Landscape, the Ethics of AI, and Prompt Engineering using Dr. Tyson Swetnam's [Generative AI and Prompt Engineering Workshop](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/). I practiced these prompt engineering skills using by writing these [Prompt Engineering Examples](promptengineeringexamples.md). 
### 6/10/2025
Today, I revisted the Gemini API generation issue, and I learned that Dr. Swetnam needs to go into the system and give me permission to generate an API Key from UofA's Gemini. As Dr. Swetnam was working on that, I used [CyVerse's Verde AI](https://chat.cyverse.ai/) to generate an API Key to use in Cline. I originally  used the Deepseek-R1 model, but it was too verbose and glitchy, so I switched to the llama-4-scout model, which worked better with Cline. Next, I downloaded [File System](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem), an MCP Server, into Cline, which allows Cline to read, write, create, delete, and much more regarding my files. Then, after some testing, Dr. Swetnam fixed the permissions issue, and I was able to generate a Gemini API Key and use it to power Cline - making my setup even more powerful. I used Dr. Swetnam's [MapMaking 101](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/tutorials/publichealth/gis/) to use Cline to create a Public Health Map, however, I got timedout on using the API for exceeding its Token limit at 1.6 million tokens. So I decided to switch back to VerdeAI, which has no limit, to create the Public Health Map. After multiple attemps with both LLMs, I learned of the limitations of LLMs in the modern day, as both of them couldn't complete [Step 5](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/tutorials/publichealth/gis/#step-5-build-a-storytelling-leaflet-map) consistently. After a few more attempts, Verde created an HTML file for the final output - but it was incomplete and missing data. After many attempts, I went to get help from an external [ChatGPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/), which helped me fix my code. I pushed it to github and opened a website using Github Pages: view [London Public Health Data](https://saishsw.github.io/London-Public-Health-Map/). I then went to D2L and completed the questions assignment for our upcoming speaker, Dr. Vignesh Subbian.
### 6/11/2025
I started the day with our first Science Seminar - which happens each wednesday morning - where I learned about Neural Networks and Clinical work with Dr. Vignesh Subbian, then we discussed our first reflection, and moved on with various annoucements concering posters, late work, and how the program will be running. Then I joined our KEYS Crew meeting, where we discussed then to schedule our recurring meetings, how logistics for the social events will work, and when to set up individual meetings with our KEYS Crew Leader. Then, I checked into lab, and started learning about [Reproducibility I: Software Environments](https://foss.cyverse.org/06_reproducibility_I/) on [CyVerse Foundational Open Science Skills 2024](https://foss.cyverse.org/) (FOSS) course. I learned about how Environment Managers can be a solution "Software Dependency Hell" by allowing your computers to create unique software installation directories to run the software in - that are isolated from your computer's PATH.
