## KEYS Internship

### 6/9/2025
Today, I started with learning how to use the Discovery Environment on CyVerse - which allows me to run applications such as Visual Studio Code(VS Code), RStudio, and Jupyter Notebook. Next, I started building my Vibecoding setup by downloading Cline - an AI Autonomous Coding Agent for VS Code, and I encountered a roadblock when trying to generate a Google Gemini API to use in Cline - I didn't have permission to generate a Gemini API Key. It was fixed by (x). Then set up Github Copilot on VS Code as well as turning on MCP(Model Context Protocol) integration into VS Code. I followed this with completing [KEYS Assignment 1: Internship Description](assignment1.md). Next, I started learning about prompt engineering using Dr. Tyson Swetnam's [Generative AI and Prompt Engineering Workshop](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/). Then Quarto and Marimo.
